# Hough-Transform-based-line-detector
This program implemented some basic image processing algorithms and putting them together to build a Hough Transform based line detector. The program is able to find the start and end points of straight line segments in images. Like most vision algorithms, the Hough Transform uses a number of parameters whose optimal values are data dependent (i.e., a set of parameter values that works really well on one image might not be best for another image). By running code and tuning parameters on the test images, it obtained optima value for each image which gives a good performance.

Here's some of the results after tuning parameters:
